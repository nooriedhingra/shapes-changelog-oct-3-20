# Shapes.inc Changelog - October 16, 2025

## Prevented Double-Send of Voice Messages on Mobile

Fixed bug where voice messages would send twice on mobile devices.

**What was happening:**
- Record voice message on mobile â†’ sends twice
- Created duplicate messages in chat
- Confusing for users and recipients

**Root cause:**
Mobile touch events were firing both `touchend` and `click`, triggering send twice.

**Solution:**

- Track send state to prevent duplicate submissions
- Mobile-specific event handling

**Technical details:**
- Updated voice message component
- Added send state guard
- Documented in mobile interaction notes

**What changed:**
- Custom instructions field now at bottom of chat settings
- Increased textarea height (3 â†’ 5 lines visible)
- Better mobile layout
- Removed markdown formatting (plain text only)

**Why:**
Custom instructions were hidden in the middle of settings. New placement makes them more discoverable and easier to edit.

**What changed:**

- Join page blocks new participants
- Lock/unlock API route
- Documented in architecture notes

## /purge Command

New moderation command for bulk message deletion.

**How it works:**

- Only room owners and moderators can use
- Confirmation modal before deletion

**Technical details:**
- New command handler in moderation system
- Batch deletion API
- Audit logging for purge actions
- Documented in moderation commands

**Why:**
Moderators needed faster way to clean up spam or inappropriate content. Manual deletion was too slow.

1. /imagine (most used)
2. /web
3. /purge
4. /slowmode
5. /ban
6. /kick

**Why:**

## Bug Fixes & UX Improvements

**Fixed Shape Name Prefix Duplication**

Assistant messages were showing redundant prefixes. Example: "Claude: âœ…" now shows as just "âœ…".

**Before:** Message showed Shape name twice (in metadata AND in message body).

**After:** Shape name only in metadata, message body clean.

**Auto-Collapse Long Messages**

Long messages (>500 chars) now automatically collapse with "Show more" button.

**Why:** Massive walls of text were overwhelming chat. Now they're hidden by default.

**Hidden Emoji Icon on Mobile**

Emoji picker button now hidden on mobile (keyboard emoji picker is better UX).

**Fixed Typing Indicator PFP Redirect**

Clicking profile picture in typing indicator no longer incorrectly redirects to shapes.inc. Now goes to user profile.

**Reverted Shape Reply Style Toggle**

Rolled back experimental reply styling due to user feedback.
