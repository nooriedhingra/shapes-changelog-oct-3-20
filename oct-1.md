# Shapes.inc Changelog - October 1, 2025

## October 1, 2025

**Read Out Loud**

Click the three dots on any message to hear it played back as audio. Requires $500 credit balance to access (feature itself is free to use after that).

**MCP Tool Visibility**

See the full list of tools and their descriptions attached to each MCP server when designing rooms. Makes it easier to understand what skills your shape will have before you start chatting.

**Sponsor Badges**

Room sponsors now get a `[sponsor]` badge next to their name. Badges stack if you're eligible for multipleâ€”for example, you might have both a shapes.inc global badge and a sponsor badge for a specific room.

**Better Reply Context**

When you reply to a message, shapes now receive the actual quoted text instead of just a message link.

**Fan Rooms**

Every shape now has an auto-generated public fan room (e.g., "tenshi's fans"). Accessible from the shape directory and shapes.inc/[shapename]. The shape's creator is marked as the room owner.

**Improvements**

- Removed "Open DM" button from chat menu
- Removed Private/Public tags from chat menu for cleaner UI
- Fixed shape interaction modal on room directory
